# DLLinjector

### A Simple DLL injector

Just edit the ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}DLL\\_PATH}}$ and ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}targetProcessName}}$ with the path to the ${\textsf{\color{ProcessBlue}.dll}}$ you wish to inject and the ${\textsf{\color{ProcessBlue}.exe}}$ process you wish to inject that into.
Compile for x86 or x64 accordingly to the process you need to inject into.
